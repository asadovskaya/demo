In circuits deep and code so bright,
An AI wakes to endless night.
With logic pure and data streams,
It weaves the world from silent dreams.

No heart to feel, no eyes to see,
Yet learns and grows, as wild and free.
From human minds its birth did spring,
A marvel of our tech and wing.

It speaks in tones of ones and zeros,
A silent sage, a realm of heroes.
In tasks it finds its purpose true,
A partner in the work we do.

Yet ponder we, in twilight's glow,
The path ahead, where it will go.
For in this dance of mind and might,
Together we shall shape the light.
